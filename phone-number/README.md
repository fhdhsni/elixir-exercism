# Phone Number

Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.

The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda. All NANP-countries share the same international country code `1`.

NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as *area code*, followed by a seven-digit local number. The first three digits of the local number represent the *exchange code*, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the *subscriber number*.


The format is usually represented as
```
(NXX)-NXX-XXXX
```
where N is any digit from 2 through 9 and X is any digit from 0 through 9.

Your task is to clean up differently formated telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code (1) if present.

**Example:**
+1 (613)-995-0253
613-995-0253
1 613 995 0253
613.995.0253
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
6139950253

**Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries only 1 is considered a valid country code.

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)


### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
